# LoanCalcWithUX
Loan Calculator finished project as envisioned by Brad Traversy - Modern JavaScript Course

This is the finished basic HTML/Bootstrap4/VanillaJS (JavaScript) code based, loan calculator from Section 4: DOM Projects.

This mini-project has some UX enhancements, like the loading animation, which I am not a fan of. The loan calculator without the UX enhancements is in another appropriately labelled repository.
